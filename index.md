# Hi, I'm Yixuan Chen

Iâ€™m currently a Research Associate at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the University of Toronto. My work focuses on **distributed machine learning**, **federated learning**, and **robotic trajectory generation**.

I am passionate about solving real-world system challenges with practical algorithms.
